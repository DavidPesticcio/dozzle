# dozzle

Dozzle is a log viewer for Docker. It's free. It's small. And it's right in your browser. Oh, did I mention it is also real-time?

While dozzle should work for most, it is not meant to be a full logging solution. For enterprise use, I recommend you look at [Loggly](https://www.loggly.com), [Papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com) or [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana).

But if you don't want to pay for those service, then you are in luck! Dozzle will be able capture all logs from your containers and send them in real-time to your browser. Installation is also very easy.

## Getting dozzle

Dozzle is a very small Docker container (8.6MB virtual). Pull the latest release from the index:

    $ docker pull amir20/dozzle:latest

## Using dozzle

The simplest way to use dozzle is to run the docker container. Also, mount the Docker Unix socket with `-volume` to `/var/run/docker.sock`:

    $ docker run --name dozzle -d --volume=/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 8888:8080 amir20/dozzle:latest

dozzle will be available at [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/). You can change `-p 8888:8080` to any port. For example, if you want to view dozzle over port 4040 then you would do `-p 4040:8080`.

#### Security

dozzle doesn't support authentication out of the box. You can control the device dozzle binds to by passing `--addr` parameter. For example,

    $ docker run --volume=/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 8888:1224 amir20/dozzle:latest --addr localhost:1224

will bind to `localhost` on port `1224`. You can then use use reverse proxy to control who can see dozzle.

#### Changing base URL

dozzle by default mounts to "/". If you want to control the base path you can use the `--base` option. For example, if you want to mount at "/foobar",
then you can override by using `--base /foobar`.

    $ docker run --volume=/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 8888:1224 amir20/dozzle:latest --base /foobar

dozzle will be available at [http://localhost:8080/foobar/](http://localhost:8080/foobar/).


#### Environment variable, DOCKER_API_VERSION

If you see

    2018/10/31 08:53:17 Error response from daemon: client version 1.40 is too new. Maximum supported API version is 1.38

Then you need to modify `DOCKER_API_VERSION` to let dozzle know which version of the API is supported. By default, `DOCKER_API_VERSION=1.38` and you can change it to by passing `-e` flag. For example, this would change the `DOCKER_API_VERSION` to `1.20`

    $ docker run --volume=/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -e DOCKER_API_VERSION=1.20 -p 8888:8080 amir20/dozzle:latest

If you are not sure what to set `DOCKER_API_VERSION` then run `docker version` which will show supported API version.
